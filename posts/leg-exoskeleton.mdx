# Leg Exoskeleton for Multiple Sclerosis

Date: 2023
Description: Senior Capstone Project. Create a proof of concept to validate the usage of linear actuators as a propulsion mechanism for future soft-suit exoskeleton prototype.
Skills: C++ | Arduino Uno | Embedded Systems | Team Collaboration | Presentations

I was tasked with embedding the software to an Arduino Uno and getting it to match the actuators to move in a natural walking gait cycle. After calibrating the linear actuators and making sure they are moving into the correct positions when embedding code. I was given speed, distance, and time variables from my teammate. Using those variables I was able to create functions in C++ to perform the gait cycle of an average individual.

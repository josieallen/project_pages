## What is the 8 queens problem? 

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. 
In chess a queen can attack vertically, horizontally or diagnolly.

The image below shows a solution to the 8 queens problem.

## How to solve this problem using a genetic algorithm? 

To solve this problem I had to create a genetic algorithm(GA). 
A genetic algorithm is an a way to solve a problem imitating biology, specifically, mutation, crossover,
and selection. 

### Selection
Selection in nature is how animals find a mate. Typically out of the options given the animal would
choose the best mate. Whether it is by the color of their fur, their stregth or if they are good hunters. 
In order to simulate this in an algorithm and simulate the randomness of finding a good mate or not. 

I choose 3 random individuals from the population and have them fight in a tournment gladiator style and may the best mate win. 

The best fit individual would then have the chance to mate and create offspring and hopefully create better fit 
children.

```
def selection(population):
  # array for 3 individual tourney
  ind = []

  tourney = 3
  # add random individuals
  for n in range(tourney):
    ind.append(random.randint(0,pop_size - 1))

  min = 101
  # fine best fit in tourney
  for n in range(tourney):
    if ind[n] < min:
      min = ind[n]


  # index space where best fitness is
  return population[min]

```

### Crossover 

Crossover in nature is the offspring. Think of the randomness of genes and how two different individuals 
can have a child with a mixture of genes. That is essentially crossover. In my case I am imitating sharing genes in a
way that gets a random number 1-8 and swaps the genes. For example if ```11111111``` and ```00000000``` were to "mate" and have offspring. 
My crossover algorithm will choose a random number 1-7, let's say it chose 3. The crossover point would be ```111|11111``` and ```000|00000```.Then after crossing over there will be two children ```11100000``` and ```00011111```. Since my genome has to be an array of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. It is a bit tricky to make the crossover happen to not 
have repeated numbers included which is why I used permutations. This will help solve the problem by making sure there is only one queen in each row. 

```
def crossover(ind1, ind2):
  # get random crossover point not including the end points
  point = random.randint(1,6)

  # copy parent genomes to crossover
  p1 = ind1.genome
  p2 = ind2.genome

  # empy array to place new crossed over genes
  c1 = []
  c2 = []

  # Copy over array before crossover point
  for x in range(point):
    if (x <= point):
      c1.append(p1[x])
      c2.append(p2[x])

  # start index at x-over point

  # check if not in the array and crossover
  # cycle to begining to maintain permutation
  while(len(c1) < len(p1) or len(c2) < len(p2)):

    if p2[point] not in c1 and len(c1) < len(p1):
      c1.append(p2[point])
    if p1[point] not in c2 and len(c2) < len(p2):
      c2.append(p1[point])
    point += 1
    point = point % 8

  # create individuals as children
  child1 = individual()
  child2 = individual()

  # make the genome equal new childrens
  child1.genome = c1
  child2.genome = c2

  # return two children
  return child1, child2
```
### Mutation 

Mutation is to create random genes or new genes. This helps simulate evolution. Like fish getting an extra fin to swim faster. 

In this case the mutation happens to the individual itself so swapping two random numbers within its own genes. 

```
def mutate(self):
    a = random.randint(0,7)
    b = random.randint(0,7)

    # swap variables
    temp = self.genome[a]
    self.genome[a] = self.genome[b]
    self.genome[b] = temp
```

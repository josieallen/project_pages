# This is MDX! Stuff can happen here.

- It has all the markdown for easy writing.
- It can have React components embedded into the markdown.
- Each blog post folder is practically a website unto itself.
- It can have scoped styles using filename.module.css in the blog post folder
- It can have it's own layout using nested layouts.
- Probably some other stuff too. Who knows.

## And this is a sub heading.

Why?

### Because we can!

That was a sub sub heading. The subbiest of sub headings, except for sub heading levels 4, 5, and 6.

And a picture why not, they go in /public so we can access them at will. This one is in /public/blog/imagename.png.

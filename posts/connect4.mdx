## What is connect four? 
Connect Four is a game where two players take turns placing coins in a 6 x 7 game board. The 
first player to get their coins 4 in a row wins. They can get 4 in a row horizontally, 
vertically and diagonally. The board is upright so you have to put the coins in coin slots and they goto 
the bottom of the board. For example player 1 placed a "coin" in column 0 and it slides down the slot to the bottom 
and player two's is placed in row 2 and goes to the bottom.  

```
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

## Making an AI to play connect 4 with. 

To keep this relatively simple I am not using any graphics and playing in the terminal. 
The player goes first and the computer goes next. To make the computer "smarter" and not just choose 
random columns. I will implement minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning.

### Minimax Algorithm 

The below pseudocode is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax "minimax")

. 
```
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) is
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, FALSE))
        return value
    else (* minimizing player *)
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, TRUE))
        return value
```
### Alpha-beta Pruning 

The following pseudocode is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning. 

```
function alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer) is
    if depth == 0 or node is terminal then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, FALSE))
            if value > β then
                break (* β cutoff *)
            α := max(α, value)
        return value
    else
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, TRUE))
            if value < α then
                break (* α cutoff *)
            β := min(β, value)
        return value
```

## Animated spinning squares using Tailwind CSS

I wanted to add some type of movement to my website. So on my homepage I have this 
animation below.\\\


<SquareAnimation />



To create the animation I created two div's with borders for the boxes. One with a rotation of 45 degrees so the squares will be offset from eachother. 

```
<div className="flex flex-grow justify-center items-center">
          <div className=" rotate-45 flex justify-center w-40 h-40 md:w-56 md:h-56 absolute items-center  border-2 dark:border-white border-black animate-spin-square-left"></div>
          <div className="flex justify-center w-40 h-40 md:w-56 md:h-56 items-center border-2 border-[#E6A297] animate-spin-square-right"></div>
</div>
```

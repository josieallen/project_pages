### Why did I create a website? 

I wanted to create a website since having some sort of portfolio is considered the norm 
in today's job market. I wanted to showcase some things I work on for future employers and 
also friends and family when they ask me what I work on. 


## How I built this site: 

To create the Next.js app I used the this command  ```npx create-next-app@latest``` .
When installed it will ask you the following questions: 
```
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

Depending on your preferences you can choose what you want. More documentation is at 
[nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation "next.js installation").

After getting the intial site set up. I created a github repository. 

## Deploying the website on the web. 

To deploy this site I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home " Vercel Website"). After you create 
your account you can deploy your website by connecting your github repo. Whenever I push to my 
repo the site will redeploy with my new additions. 

## Design Theme 

My theme is very basic and straight forward. I went with this theme to keep it as simple as 
possible while also showcasing my projects. [Definitely not my lacking artistic skills.] 

I used tailwindcss to style this site. I think the trickiest part of the styling was utilizing prose 
and breaking ```prose``` when I did not want to use prose. When I created the dark/light theme button 
I had to figure out how to make prose invert too. Crazy that there is a  ```prose-invert``` call. 

## Using MDX for project pages. 

I am dynamically getting all my project pages[MDX files] from a [github repo](https://github.com/sagewaviness/project_pages "my project pages repo"). 
Each project has its own page and the front matter is used to make the index page cards. 
The rest of the mdx page is the content. That is what is on the page after you click on the cards. 

This will be awesome if I ever want to create a new site and all my content is already in a repo. Not directly in
the site itself. 

## Future additions. 
- I want to dynamically get all my images and not just the mdx files from a github repo. 
- Add more animations.
- Themed pages for my projects. 
- Favicon 
- Figure out how to embed some code so users don't have to click on links to test out my code. (especially my connect four game). 
- More content

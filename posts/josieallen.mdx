***Tech Stack:*** Vercel, Next.js, HTML, Tailwindcss, Visual Studio Code, Git. 

## Why did I create a website? 

Having some sort of portfolio is considered the norm in today's job market. I wanted to showcase some things I work on for future 
employers. Also friends and family when they ask me what I work on. 

## How I built this site: 

To create the Next.js app I used the this command  ```npx create-next-app@latest``` .
When installed it will ask you the following questions: 

```
What is your project named? josieallen
Would you like to use TypeScript? [ No ] / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? [ No ]/ Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No /[ Yes ]
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / [ Yes ]
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / [ Yes ]
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? [ No ]/ Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

I added my responses to my specific project but depending on your preferences 
you may choose differently. More documentation is at 
[nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation "next.js installation").

After getting the intial site set up. I created a github repository. 

## Deploying the website on the web. 

To deploy this site I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home " Vercel Website"). After you create 
your account you can deploy your website by connecting your github repo. Whenever I push to my 
repo the site will redeploy with my new additions. 

## Design Theme 
My theme is very basic and straight forward. I went with this theme to keep it as simple as 
possible while also showcasing my projects. [Definitely not my lacking artistic skills.] 

### Challenges
I used tailwindcss to style this site. I think the trickiest part of the styling was utilizing prose 
and breaking ```prose``` when I did not want to use prose. When I created the dark/light theme button 
I had to figure out how to make prose invert too. Crazy that there is a  ```prose-invert``` call. 

## Using MDX for project pages. 

I am dynamically getting all my project pages[MDX files] from a [github repo](https://github.com/sagewaviness/project_pages "my project pages repo"). 
The front matter is used to make cards for the index page. The rest of the mdx page is the content for each page. 

In order to get this to work I used github api. You essentially have to set up a token in github. 
You can do this by going to `Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)`. 
Then copying that token and putting it in a `.env` file `GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token`. 

In my `/lib` folder I have a `github.js` file that gets the mdx files from the repo. 

```
import axios from 'axios';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

const GITHUB_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com';
const REPO_OWNER = 'josieallen';
const REPO_NAME = 'project_pages';
const BRANCH = 'main'; 
const DIRECTORY = 'posts';
const TOKEN = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN; //your token

export async function fetchMdxFiles() {
  const url = `${GITHUB_API_URL}/repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/contents/${DIRECTORY}?ref=${BRANCH}`;
  const headers = {
    Authorization: `token ${TOKEN}`,
  };

  try {
    const response = await axios.get(url, { headers });

    if (!Array.isArray(response.data)) {
      throw new Error('Expected response data to be an array');
    }

    const files = response.data.filter(file => file.name.endsWith('.mdx'));

    const mdxFiles = await Promise.all(
      files.map(async file => {
        const fileResponse = await axios.get(file.download_url, { headers });
        const content = fileResponse.data;
        const { data: frontMatter, content: mdxContent  } = matter(content);
        return {
          filename: file.name,
          frontMatter,
          content: mdxContent,
        };
      })
    );

    return mdxFiles;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching MDX files:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

This will be awesome if I ever want to create a new site and all my content is already in a repo. Not directly in
the site itself. 

*You need to install mdx gray-matter axios next-mdx-remote remark-frontmatter*

## Final Thoughts??  
- I want to dynamically get all my images and not just the mdx files from a github repo. 
- Add more animations.
- Themed pages for my projects. 
- More content. LOTS more content. 
- Breadcrumbs for project pages.

### Why did I create a website? 

I wanted to create a website since having some sort of portfolio is considered the norm 
in today's job market. I wanted to showcase some things I work on for future employers and 
also friends and family when they ask me what I work on. 

## Design Theme 

My theme is very basic and straight forward. I went with this theme to keep it as simple as 
possible while also showcasing my projects. [Definitely not my lacking artistic skills.] 

## How I built this site: 

To create the Next.js app I used the this command  ```npx create-next-app@latest``` .
When installed it will ask you the following questions: 
```
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

Depending on your preferences you can choose what you want. More documentation is at 
[nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation "next.js installation").

After getting the intial site set up. I created a github repository. 

## Deploying the website on the web. 

To deploy this site I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home " Vercel Website"). After you create 
your account you can deploy your website by connecting your github repo. Whenever I push to my 
repo the site will redeploy with my new additions. 

## Using MDX for project pages. 

## Future additions. 
- I want to dynamically get all my images and not just the mdx files from a github repo. 
Just so if I ever update or change my site all of my projects will be in github. I won't have 
to rewrite all my project pages over again. 
- Add more animations.
- Themed pages for my projects. 
- Favicon 
- More content

## 2D Pixel Art Game

This was a school team project. We built a 2D Pixel Art game. 
I was in charge of menus, inventory, health bar and points. This project was a collaborative school effort where we developed a 2D pixel art game. My responsibilities included designing and implementing the menus, inventory system, health bar, and points tracking.

I also led the platforming adaptation, transitioning the game from PC to mobile, which involved integrating haptic feedback for an enhanced user experience.

### Overview: 

I wrote a relational knowledge base in prolog. The program sets up rules for family members 
such as:  mother, father, brother, sister, grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle and ancestor. The 
goal of the program is to be able to query the knowledge base and it correctly tell us relational facts. 

### Prolog Language: 

Prolog is a LOGical PROgraming language. It is based on facts and rules. Rules being the 
prolog functions and facts being the truth you tell it. 

### SYNTAX DESCRIPTION: 

My *rules* are set up as the image below. A father is a male and a parent. 
```
father(F, Y) :-
   male(F),
   parent(F, Y).
```
To create a *fact* that Abraham is the father to Chance you would say
`father(abraham, chance).`. 


### Full Code and Knowledge base 
```
father(F, Y) :-
   male(F),
   parent(F, Y).

mother(M,Y) :-
   female(M),
   parent(M,Y).

grandfather(G, Y) :- 
   male(G),
   parent(G, P),
   parent(P, Y).
   
grandmother(G, Y) :-
   female(G),
   parent(G, P),
   parent(P, Y).

sister(X,Y) :-
   female(X),
   parent(P,X),
   parent(P,Y),
   =\=(X, Y).

brother(X, Y) :-
   male(X), 
   parent(P, X),
   parent(P, Y),
  =\=(X,Y).

aunt(A,Y) :-
  female(A),
  parent(P,Y),
  sister(A,P).

uncle(U,Y) :-
  male(U),
  parent(P,Y), 
  brother(U, P).

ancestor(A,Y) :- 
   parent(Z, Y),
   ancestor(A, Z).

```

```
male(al).      
male(carl).    
male(ed).      
male(frank).   
male(duncan).
male(kurt).     
male(rene).    
male(vinny).    
male(tony).

female(berta).  
female(dora).  
female(tina).  
female(deb).   
female(jane).
female(laura).  
female(mia).   
female(olga).  
female(wendy).  
female(susan).
female(linda).

parent(al,tdeb).   
parent(al,duncan).   
parent(carl,deb).   
parent(carl,jane).
parent(ed,kurt).    
parent(frank,mia).  
parent(frank,olga). 
parent(duncan,wendy).
parent(duncan,rene).  
parent(duncan,vinny).  
parent(kurt,tony).  
parent(kurt,linda).    

parent(berta,tdeb). 
parent(berta,hugo). 
parent(dora,deb).   
parent(dora,jane).
parent(tina,mia).   
parent(tina,olga).  
parent(deb,wendy).   
parent(deb,rene).
parent(deb,vinny).   
parent(jane,susan). 
parent(laura,tony). 
parent(laura,linda).
```

### Querying: 

In order to query and compile this code I had to install [GNU Prolog](http://www.gprolog.org/ "prolog compiler").
Like python you have to open the environment run your code and then you can query. 

### RESULTS:

My results were good, it correctly tells me simple queries and more complicated queries. Below are some of the queries I tested. 

Querying *"who is the brother of deb?"* or `brother(X, deb).`

Querying *"Does Jane have an uncle?"* or `uncle(A, jane).`

![Images of prolog uncle(f|y)](/img/prologQ3.png)

Querying *"Who are all the mothers and who are their children?"* or `mother(X,Y).`

![Images of prolog mother(f|y)](/img/prologQ4.png)

Querying *"Who are all the grandmothers and who are their grandchildren?"*  or `grandmother(X,Y).`

Querying *"Who are Jane's parents?"* or `parent(X, jane).`

### DISCUSSION: 

The strengths of the program is prolog is easy to use and adding new rules to the knowledge base 
was easy after you got the hang of the language. It was overly simple to the point where I thought 
I was doing it wrong at first. It kind of reminds me of caveman talk “Father. Man! Parent!”.

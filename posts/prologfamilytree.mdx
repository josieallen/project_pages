### Prolog Knowledge Base

ABSTRACT: 
	I wrote a relational knowledge base in prolog. The program sets up rules for family members such as:  mother, father, brother, sister, grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle and ancestor. The goal of the program is to be able to query the knowledge base and it correctly can tell us if someone is related based on the facts implemented. My results were good. I was able to search for all relatives and do more specific searches like finding parents of one of the members. It successfully returned all mothers when searched.

SYNTAX DESCRIPTION: 
	My rules are set up as the image below. A father is a male and a parent. This would be used like father(abraham, chance) to create a fact that Abraham is the father to Chance. I have rules like this for all relations. To view them all, reference the Appendix.

RESULTS:
My results are all good, it correctly tells me simple queries and more complicated queries. Below are some of the queries I tested. 

DISCUSSION: 
The strengths of the program is that it works and is relatively simple to code. Prolog would not be a very functional language for complex problems it would get tedious especially for large knowledge bases or complex facts. However, it was a super easy knowledge base to implement, I liked the simplicity of it, but it might be overly simple for large scale knowledge bases.  The weaknesses of this program is querying, I think learning how to query and giving it a query correctly is a bit tricky. Especially with a large knowledge base where you’d have to query multiple facts. 
Prolog is easy to use and adding new rules to the knowledge base was easy after you got the hang of the language. It was overly simple to the point where I thought I was doing it wrong at first. It kind of reminds me of caveman talk “Father. Man! Parent!”. I liked the simplicity of it, it was an easy language to pick up because its simple. Overall,  I enjoyed coding in Prolog it was a good experience.
